# Welcome

Hello, my name is Dmitrii Pedchenko. I am a research scientist currently working on machine learning infrastructure questions in Big Tech. Previously, I spent around 7 years in academia getting my PhD and workings as a professor, both in pure math (algebraic geometry). Evene before that I worked in business consulting.

My current research interests lie in mathematical foundations of Deep Learning. That said, I try to follow all the major theoretical and practical advances in Deep and Machine Learning. Most of my thinking is done together with [Daniel Levine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielflevine/).

You can reach me and check my work history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrii-pedchenko-7464b11b0/).
