<h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrii-pedchenko-7464b11b0/">Dmitrii Pedchenko</a>. I am a research scientist currently working on machine learning infrastructure questions in Big Tech. Previously, I spent around 7 years in academia getting my PhD and workings as a professor, both in pure math (algebraic geometry). Even before that I worked in business consulting.</p>

<p>My current research interests lie in mathematical foundations of Deep Learning. That said, I try to follow all the major theoretical and practical advances in Deep and Machine Learning. Most of my thinking is done together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielflevine/">Daniel Levine</a>.</p>

<p>You can reach me and check my work history on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrii-pedchenko-7464b11b0/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
